# AGENTS.md

Project-specific guidance for coding agents. Global conventions (response style, TypeScript / React / Next.js / Tailwind rules, git, tooling, personas) live in the user's global rules and are **not** repeated here. This file is only what's true for THIS repo and not inferable from the framework or `@package.json`.

## Project Overview

Business management dashboard for cash registers, transfers, investments, and employees. Next.js + Payload CMS. **Polish UI, English code.** Versions in `@package.json`.

## Backlog & Task Tracking

- **Slices:** `context/foundation/roadmap.md` is the source of truth — the v2 arc (`F-01`, `S-01`…`S-10`) in dependency order, each with a `Status` field (`ready` / `proposed` / `blocked` / `done`). Start here for what to build next. Built from `context/foundation/prd.md` via `/10x-roadmap`; per-change plans land in `context/changes/<change-id>/` via `/10x-plan`.
- **Todos & live status:** Linear project **"Wykonczymy v2"** only — the slice-status mirror plus every smaller / ad-hoc task. No second todo file. When you start a slice set its Linear issue to In Progress, and to Done when complete. **Reality-check Linear access first** — if the Linear MCP isn't connected, update the slice's `Status` in `roadmap.md` rather than claim a Linear change you can't make.
- **All prose docs live under `context/`** (`foundation/` durable, `changes/` in-flight, `archive/` done, `reference/` standalone references) — never create a top-level `docs/` dir.
- **Doc lifecycle:** a one-off design/plan doc is not current truth — verify its claims against code before trusting or quoting it. When a change ships, extract the durable rationale into the right living doc (`lessons.md` / a `foundation/` or `context/reference/` doc), then **archive** the raw doc under `context/archive/<slug>/`. Delete only pure scaffolds with zero unique rationale.
- Refactor/cleanup backlog: see **Tech Debt** below.
- After ANY bigger change, plan/implementation etc. update the relevant living doc and clean up stale plans/designs per the Doc lifecycle rule above.

## Common Commands

Scripts live in `@package.json`. Non-obvious ones:

```bash
pnpm build         # generate:importmap + generate:types + next build (NO migrate — see Migrations)
pnpm exec vitest run src/__tests__/some-file.test.ts  # single test file — pnpm 10 no longer forwards `--` to nested scripts
pnpm generate:types  # regenerate src/payload-types.ts (gitignored — never `git add` it)
docker compose up -d  # local Postgres on port 5433
```

### Migrations

`pnpm migrate:create` has emitted phantom drift since ~March 2026 (missing `.json` snapshots), so **hand-write migrations**: copy the structure of the latest file in `src/migrations/` and adjust FK constraints / internal Payload tables by hand. Don't trust an auto-generated migration blindly.

**Migrations are NO LONGER run by the build.** `payload migrate` was removed from `pnpm build` so a Vercel deploy (incl. previews) can never touch the schema — code and schema are separate planes. Apply migrations to prod deliberately with **`pnpm db:migrate:prod`** (dumps Neon prod first, then `payload migrate` against `DB_POSTGRES_URL_PROD`), run by a **human**, never the agent. A `.husky/pre-push` gate reminds you on a push to `main` that adds `src/migrations/*.ts`. Order: migrate prod **before** pushing the code that needs it. Pattern owned by the `payload-prod-migrate` skill.

### Dependencies

Prefer hand-editing `@package.json` over `pnpm remove` / `pnpm install`. On this arm64 machine those re-link `node_modules` and can swap the native `lightningcss` binary to x64 — dropping `lightningcss.darwin-arm64.node` and breaking the Tailwind v4 / Turbopack CSS build with an error that blames `src/styles/globals.css`. Repair: `pnpm install --force`, then `rm -rf .next` and restart dev. Detail: `context/foundation/lessons.md`.

## Databases And Live Data

- **The real DB is Neon Postgres** — `DB_POSTGRES_URL_PROD` in `.env` is the live prod credential. **Never run SQL, migrations, or dumps-restores against the Neon URL**; a human applies prod migrations.
- The local app points at the docker Postgres on 5433 (`DB_POSTGRES_URL`, db `wykonczymy-db`) — a copy restored from Neon dumps: `pnpm db:dump` (prod → `dumps/dump-latest.sql`, also run by the pre-push hook) and `pnpm db:import` (dump → local). Refreshable, but confirm before wiping it — a restore loses anything entered locally since the last dump.
- `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` and `KOSZTORYS_TEMPLATE_SHEET_ID` in `.env` are real working credentials — Google Sheets writes hit live data.
- Never `git push`; a human pushes to remotes.

## Architecture

### Route Groups

- `src/app/(frontend)` — main authenticated app
- `src/app/(auth)` — login page
- `src/app/(payload)` — Payload admin panel and API routes

### Important Directories

- `src/collections` — Payload collection configs
- `src/access` — role-based access control
- `src/lib/actions` — server actions for mutations
- `src/lib/queries` — server-side fetching and cached reference data
- `src/lib/auth` — JWT auth and roles
- `src/lib/db` — raw SQL financial calculations
- `src/lib/cache` — cache tags and revalidation helpers
- `src/components/forms` — TanStack React Form setup
- `src/components/ui` — Shadcn UI components
- `src/stores` — Zustand stores
- `src/types` — shared TypeScript types
- `src/migrations` — Payload migrations

## Auth And Roles

JWT auth via Payload using the `payload-token` cookie (24h lifetime). Roles: `ADMIN`, `OWNER`, `MANAGER`, `EMPLOYEE`. Hierarchy in `src/lib/auth/roles.ts`; access control functions in `src/access`.

## Mutation Pattern

All mutations go through `protectedAction()` in `src/lib/actions`:

- `'use server'`
- `requireAuth()`
- perf logging via `perfStart()`
- return `ActionResultT`
- trigger cache revalidation where needed

## Data Fetching And Cache

- Server components use `getPayload({ config })` or `fetchReferenceData()`
- Financial calculations use raw SQL via `@vercel/postgres`
- Cache uses `unstable_cache` with tag-based invalidation; `cacheComponents` and `'use cache'` are disabled because of a documented Vercel bug (see `docs/vercel-server-action-bug-report.md` - currently in git commit history)
- Revalidation differs by context: in **server actions** (`lib/actions`, `lib/cache/revalidate.ts`) use `updateTag()` for immediate expiration; in **Payload hooks** (`hooks/`) use `revalidateTag()` — hooks run in a Route Handler context where `updateTag` throws. Never import `lib/cache/revalidate.ts` from a Payload hook.

## Forms

- TanStack React Form via the custom `useAppForm()` hook (not React Hook Form)
- Optimistic updates use `useOptimisticFormStore` (Zustand), fire-and-forget

## Transfer Business Logic

The transfer-type union lives in `src/collections/transfers.ts` — read it there rather than trusting a copy (this list has gone stale before).

Non-obvious rules:

- `LABOR_COST` (robocizna) has **no source register** — it is a billing/markup figure, not a cash movement. It feeds the margin (`marża = robocizna − wypłaty − rabat − strata`), not the cash ledger.
- `CORRECTION` may be negative (invoice credits).
- `RABAT` (rabat) is a labour discount: **no source register**, positive amount, requires an investment. It hits **both** figures — lowers `marża` and raises `bilans` (the client owes less) — unlike `CORRECTION`, which moves only the balance.
- `LOSS` (strata) is a company-absorbed cost: **no source register**, positive amount, investment **optional**. It only lowers `marża`; `bilans` is untouched — unlike `RABAT`, which moves both.
- Cancellation is an audit trail: the original is marked `cancelled: true`, a new `CANCELLATION` row links back to it.
- Cash register balances are recalculated via Payload hooks on transfer create and delete.

How the financial figures (marża / materiały / robocizna / korekty) connect: `context/foundation/investment-financials-and-discount.md`.

## Testing

Vitest unit specs under `src/__tests__` (aliases `@/*` → `./src/*`); single-file command in **Common Commands**. No E2E harness exists yet.

Don't hand-roll tests or pick the layer by feel — route to a skill. Always start from a risk in test-plan.md, never from "cover this file"; the cheapest layer that gives a real signal wins. The trap behind every bad test — assert observable behavior, not the implementation under test — and the full anti-pattern lists are owned by the skills (/10x-tdd, /10x-e2e's references/) and test-plan.md; don't restate them here.

- **New code, test-first** → **`/10x-tdd`** (when you can name the first failing test in one sentence and the impl isn't written yet).
- **Protecting existing code** → `/10x-research` → `/10x-plan` → `/10x-implement`, anchored on the risk.
- **Browser-level / multi-boundary risk** → **`/10x-e2e`** — but there is no Playwright setup in this repo yet, so setting one up is its own change, not a side effect of a test task // we will add playwright.
- **A bug that slipped past the tests (test-driven debugging) — mandatory, not optional.** Reproduce it with a **failing test first**, then fix — never silently patch. Assert the **persisted / observable state, not the action's return value** — a success result can hide a failed write. The repro test stays as the regression guard for the path that had none.

There is no `context/foundation/test-plan.md` here yet — for a larger test rollout, generate one with `/10x-test-plan` first and anchor new tests on its risks.

## Tech Debt

Known refactor/cleanup backlog (non-blocking, judgment-heavy): `context/reference/tech-debt-backlog.md`. Check it before starting a refactor, and record new findings there rather than spawning a new audit doc.

## Stack Notes

- React Compiler is enabled — don't hand-write `useMemo` / `useCallback` for things it handles
- `src/app/(payload)/layout.tsx` must include `importMap`, `serverFunction`, and `handleServerFunctions`

## Environment Variables

Read env **only** through the validated layer in `src/lib/` — never raw `process.env` (an ESLint
`no-restricted-syntax` rule enforces it; `NODE_ENV` is the lone exception). Schemas live in
`env-schema.ts`; client entry is `env.ts` (`FRONTEND_URL`), server entry `env.server.ts` (`serverEnv`).

Traps:

- `env.server.ts` is `server-only` — **never import it from the Payload CLI graph** (`payload.config.ts`
  / collections), where `server-only` throws under `payload generate:types`. That's why
  `payload.config.ts` is the one file allowlisted to read raw `process.env`.
- `(frontend)/layout.tsx` imports both entries as the build gate (a missing var fails `next build`) —
  don't delete those seemingly-unused imports.
- Tests alias both entries to passthrough stubs (`src/__tests__/stubs/`); the eager parse otherwise
  forces every server-touching test to supply the whole env.
