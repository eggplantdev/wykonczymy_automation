# Settled corrections + investment-financials parity (single source of truth)

Date: 2026-06-19
Status: implemented + audited + verified on branch `feat/settled-correction-parity` (2026-06-19)

## Problem

The same per-investment figures (bilans, marża, materiały, wydatki inwestycyjne,
wypłaty) are shown in two places and computed by **two different code paths**:

- **Listing** (`/inwestycje`) — one bulk SQL query for all investments at once:
  `sumAllInvestmentFinancials()` in `src/lib/db/sum-transfers.ts`
  (`GROUP BY investment_id`).
- **Detail** (`/inwestycje/[id]`) — per-investment, filterable path:
  `sumFilteredByType()` + `sumCategoryBreakdown()` + `sumSettledCategoryBreakdown()`
  → `deriveFinancials()`.

Both paths converge on the **same** display-layer functions
(`calculateBalance`, `calculateMargin`, category sums), so the _formulas_ never
diverge. The divergence lives one layer down: **which rows each SQL query puts into
each bucket** (materiały vs settled vs income …).

### The concrete divergence: a settled CORRECTION

A `settled = true` row means a material expense is "wliczone w robociznę" — it leaves
the register, is **not** billed to the client (off bilans), and **lowers marża**.

For `CORRECTION` rows the two paths disagree:

- **Listing** `total_costs`: `type IN ('INVESTMENT_EXPENSE','CORRECTION') AND settled IS NOT TRUE`
  → a settled CORRECTION is **excluded** from materiały.
- **Detail** `deriveFinancials`: `totalMaterialCosts = INVESTMENT_EXPENSE + CORRECTION`,
  where only `INVESTMENT_EXPENSE` is re-bucketed out when settled
  (`sumFilteredByType` maps settled `INVESTMENT_EXPENSE` → `INVESTMENT_EXPENSE_SETTLED`).
  A settled CORRECTION is **kept** in materiały.

Today this is **latent**, not active: the create action coerces `settled = false` for
any non-`INVESTMENT_EXPENSE` type (`src/lib/actions/transfers.ts:142`), the form hides
the checkbox for `CORRECTION`, and the edit form never touches `settled`. So no
settled CORRECTION should exist in current data — but the Payload admin panel has no
hard guard, so this must be verified against real data, not assumed.

### The business gap behind it

A `CORRECTION` is a **freestanding, investment-level** adjustment to material costs
(amount may be negative; the only back-link in the schema is `cancelledTransaction`,
gated to `CANCELLATION`). When you need to correct material that was **settled** (folded
into robocizna), today there is **no correct representation**:

- A normal (non-settled) CORRECTION hits bilans — wrong, the client was never billed.
- A settled CORRECTION would correctly stay off bilans, but the margin bucket
  (`total_settled` = `type = 'INVESTMENT_EXPENSE' AND settled`) ignores CORRECTION
  entirely, so margin would not move — the credit vanishes.

**Target semantics (confirmed):** a settled CORRECTION mirrors a settled
`INVESTMENT_EXPENSE` — off bilans, into `totalSettled` → moves marża. A `−200` credit
on settled material ⇒ bilans unchanged, marża +200.

## Decisions (locked)

1. **Mechanism:** reuse the existing "Wliczone w robociznę" checkbox; show it for
   `CORRECTION` too. No link to an original transaction (user owns the judgment).
2. **Semantics:** settled applies symmetrically to `INVESTMENT_EXPENSE` and
   `CORRECTION`. Implementing this correctly _is_ the fix for the listing/detail
   divergence.
3. **Refactor variant: 2c — "dumb SQL + one JS classifier"** (single source of truth).
4. **Baseline first:** before any production-code change, capture current figures for
   every investment via both paths into a file, to find current outliers and to serve
   as a before/after regression baseline.
5. **File format:** JSON (exact machine diff) **and** CSV (human/spreadsheet) from the
   same run.

## Architecture (variant 2c)

Move the bucketing rule — "(type, settled) → which bucket" — into **one** place (JS).
SQL only sums raw amounts.

- Both queries return **raw** sums grouped by `(investment_id, type, settled,
expense_category_id)`. SQL no longer encodes business rules (drop the inline
  `total_costs` / `total_settled` CASE soup and the `sumFilteredByType` settled
  re-bucket CASE).
- `deriveFinancials` is extended to receive `settled` and perform **all** bucketing in
  JS, including the settled re-bucket currently done in SQL.
- **Listing** groups the raw rows by `investment_id` and calls `deriveFinancials` per
  investment. **Detail** calls `deriveFinancials` for its single investment.
- Same function, same inputs → same output, **by construction**.

Not a performance regression: the listing still runs ~1 query; finer grouping yields a
few thousand rows for ~200 investments, grouped in JS — trivial.

### Bucketing rule after change (symmetric)

- `INVESTMENT_EXPENSE` or `CORRECTION` with `settled = true` → out of materiały/bilans,
  into `totalSettled` (and `settledCategoryCosts` by category) → lowers marża.
- `settled = false` → unchanged from today.
- bilans formula (`calculate-balance.ts`) and marża formula (`calculate-margin.ts`)
  are **unchanged** — only their inputs change.

## Surface changes (form / action / collection)

- `src/components/forms/expense-form/expense-form.tsx`: show the `settled` checkbox for
  `CORRECTION` as well as `INVESTMENT_EXPENSE`.
- `src/lib/actions/transfers.ts` (~`:142`): allow `settled` to persist for
  `type IN ('INVESTMENT_EXPENSE','CORRECTION')`.
- `src/collections/transfers.ts` (~`:237`): widen the `admin.condition` for the
  `settled` field to include `CORRECTION`.
- **Guard** in `src/hooks/transfers/validate.ts`: force `settled = false` for any type
  other than `INVESTMENT_EXPENSE` / `CORRECTION`, so the admin panel cannot persist a
  stray settled flag on an unrelated type.

## Baseline / snapshot tool (Phase 0)

Read-only script against the **local Docker** Postgres (never Neon). For every
investment, compute all six figures via **both** the listing path and the detail path,
and emit:

- `*.json` — exact values for machine diff (before/after).
- `*.csv` — same data, human-readable, with a `match?` column (listing == detail) so
  current outliers are visible at a glance.

Columns per investment (`id`, `name`):

| figure          | listing source            | detail source            |
| --------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| bilans          | `calculateBalance` (bulk) | `calculateBalance` (per) |
| marża           | `calculateMargin` (bulk)  | `calculateMargin` (per)  |
| materiały       | `totalMaterialCosts`      | `totalMaterialCosts`     |
| wydatki inwest. | sum of `categoryCosts`    | sum of `categoryCosts`   |
| wypłaty         | `totalPayouts`            | `totalPayouts`           |
| settled         | `totalSettled`            | `totalSettled`           |

Roundness: figures rounded consistently (e.g. 2 dp) before comparison so float
formatting does not create false diffs.

## Testing

- **Unit parity test** (permanent CI guard): synthetic transaction sets fed through
  **both** paths (both ultimately `deriveFinancials`); assert all six figures equal.
  Includes a settled-CORRECTION scenario asserting the target semantics (off bilans,
  into marża). Style mirrors `src/__tests__/sum-transfers.test.ts` (mocked
  `db.execute`).
- **Before/after diff** from Phase 0 re-run as evidence of no unintended regression.

## Phase plan

0. Build snapshot tool; run on local DB → "before" file; report current outliers.
1. Implement the change (architecture 2c + surface changes + guard).
2. Re-run snapshot → "after" file; diff before/after. Expect empty diff except
   intentional settled-CORRECTION cases (none in existing data unless Phase 0 finds a
   stray row).
3. Add the unit parity test to CI.

## Risks / notes

- 2c rewrites the listing's hot bulk query. Mitigated by the Phase 0 baseline + the
  parity test.
- If Phase 0 finds an existing settled CORRECTION, that investment's bilans/marża will
  shift to the corrected values after Phase 1 — surface it explicitly, do not silently
  change it.
- Migrations are hand-written in this repo; no schema change is needed (the `settled`
  column already exists), so no migration is expected.
- Local DB is a refreshable copy of prod; confirm before any reset. The tool is
  read-only.

## Audit & verification results (2026-06-19)

**Where the audit ran.** Against the **local Docker Postgres** (`DB_POSTGRES_URL`,
`localhost:5433/wykonczymy-db`), which is a copy of prod restored from a Neon dump.
Prod (Neon) was **never queried directly** — blocked by the PreToolUse hook and project
rules. So "found on prod" below means "found on the local copy of prod data", which is
the closest legitimate proxy. (Two test rows on investment #31 were added locally during
the session and removed; they were local-only, not from the dump.)

**Method.** `src/scripts/audit-investment-parity.ts` computes the six figures for every
investment via **both** paths (listing `sumAllInvestmentFinancials` vs detail
`sumFilteredByType` + breakdowns → `deriveFinancials`), under the **deployed** code
(pre-refactor commit) and under the **branch** code, then diffs.

**Found (deployed code, current data) — 1 live outlier:**

- **#90 "kosztorys wzór. nic nie dodajemy"** — carries a settled `CORRECTION −300`.
  - listing: `bilans 0, materiały 0` · detail: `bilans 300, materiały −300`
  - Root cause = the divergence this spec targets: the detail path kept the settled
    CORRECTION in materiały; the listing excluded it (`settled IS NOT TRUE`).

**Not divergent:** a settled `INVESTMENT_EXPENSE` (e.g. #64 Wyszogrodzka 7, 19.99) is
handled consistently by **both** deployed paths — the deployed detail query already
re-bucketed settled `INVESTMENT_EXPENSE`. So the only live divergence class is the
settled **CORRECTION**, exactly as theorised. (An earlier session run flagged #64; that
was a transient data-state artifact and did not reproduce on stable data.)

**Verified (branch code, same data):** **0 outliers across 79 investments.** #90
reconciles to `bilans 0, marża +300, settled −300` on both paths — the target semantics
(off bilans, into marża). Unit guards green: parity test, differential test
(`settled-differential.test.ts`), full suite 657/657.
